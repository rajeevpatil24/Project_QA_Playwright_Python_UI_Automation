What else can we improve in this framework / Future aspects of Framework .

1. We can make a function in conftest for running Flask app & fetching the base url from there.
2. We can write a Global function to open a browser & use that instance for all our scripts.
3. Code quality using pylint / any other tool to check the code score.
4. parallel Execution - Configure pytest to run tests in parallel to speed up execution using pytest-xdist.
5. Modularize the code , Break down large functions into smaller, reusable functions. This helps in improving readability and makes the code easier to test.
6. Other utliity functions like click_element , get_element_text , retry mechanism function .
